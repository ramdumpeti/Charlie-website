    <p>Charlie came into our lives as a tiny golden fluffball just 3 weeks old. He was curious, cuddly, and always full of energy. As he grew, so did his love for playing in the yard, rolling in the grass, and sneaking food from the kitchen.</p>
    <p>He had an uncanny ability to understand emotions and would always be by your side when you needed him most. Charlie loved car rides, beach walks, and meeting new people (especially if they had treats!).</p>
    <p>Over his 16 years, Charlie brought light into our lives every single day. He truly was our sunshine on four legs.</p>
