    <p>Charlie made every day special. Some of our most cherished moments include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>His first beach trip where he chased the waves and ran with joy.</li>
      <li>The time he “helped” us bake cookies by licking all the batter off the spoon.</li>
      <li>How he would snuggle beside us during thunderstorms to keep us brave.</li>
      <li>The final goodbye — peaceful, proud, and surrounded by love.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We love you, Charlie. Always.</p>
