    <p>Charlie was more than just a golden retriever — he was family. From the moment we brought him home at just 3 weeks old, he filled our lives with joy, loyalty, and laughter.</p>
    <p>Though Charlie is no longer with us, he lives on in every memory, every photo, and every wag of a tail we see in the park. This site is a tribute to him — our best friend.</p>
